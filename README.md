## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned to manifest the power of props and was able to understand how the props can be passed over multiple different components in a hierarichle manner.
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

This project has made me understood the core concepts of react such as functional components,props and States. But in the future I wish to learn more about libraries of react like Redux and also context.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deployment-of-react-application-using-github-pages/) - This helped me to deploy the website. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](Googlefonts) - This website has always given me good fonts to work.
